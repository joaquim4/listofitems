# listofitems
A list of items from a image

The project consists in creating a list of items from an image. It needs to be able to relate to a previous database of images.
So by we creating a structure of diferent items we are linking the new directory more alphanumeric organizational patterns. 
That way we are creating a "pick a choose" graphical interface that gives the capacity to orient better the consumer of this specific data.
By establishing this we are providing a user experience that goes more in the line of thought of a grid user.
